      <h1>Hi there, I'm Vincent</h1>
      <p>I'm a designer and developer who likes to sleep, eat, play, and design. One of my skill is being able to do user experience and user interface. UX/UI design is the process of products/website that are both visually appealing and easy to use, ensuring a positive experience for the user. UX/UI design is important because it make sure products are user-friendly, visually engaging, and effective, leading to better user satisfaction and business success. It is what every company must do before developing a product or website.</p>

    <div id="skill-section" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
      <h1>Skill</h1>
      <p>UX or user experience focus on how a product/website feels, while UI or user interface focus on the design of the product. Some techniques includes User Research, so you would do research, interview, observation, surveys all that to get the main point of what this product is for and getting idea of who the users are. To find out user needs and what is needed to create a good product for every user. Wireframing is the basic structure of the website, just the shape and content placement, and Prototyping is the stage where you add interaction buttons, color, content, all that to create a website that you can interact with and test before going live. Usability Testing is when you let real world user test out the product to find out any problems and design issue that hinders the users. UI Design Principles which is like color theory, typography, layout, and visual hierarchy, making the website easy to navigate, legible and cohesive overall design. There are many more techniques and skills within skills. </p> <br>

      <p> The benefit of knowing UX/UI design is improving user satisfaction by making it easier for the user to navigate and complete their goal, higher conversion rates because if your website is user friendly then it will result in better growth, brand loyalty and trust since if you find a website that allow you to complete your goal efficiently then they will come back. Also this help developer code the website. Another benefit is the accessibility aspect, where no matter what user, whether they have disability or not, it's good for everyone.</p> <br>

      <p>I would not say I mastered it because I'm still in the early stage of my career, I'm still learning along the way. But what helps improve my skills and others is practice. Figma is my go to for doing wireframe and prototype. This helps with UI. You can interview others and get feedback about your website or create a website base on their needs or what a communities needs. Take note, brain story ideas, you can use miro or figjam to create a site map. This help with UX. All these tools you are able to do it live with others/team. More ways to eventually master is to just stay up to date with all new tools and techniques. There are many different website, app, tools that you are able to use to design your work. Test them all out and see which one you prefer, but also just knowing all these tools allow you to be diverse for many company who need these requirement to hire you. Also try to build a portfolio to showcase all your work, whether that be slides or a website. It's good to have somewhere to showcase your work to employers. </p>
